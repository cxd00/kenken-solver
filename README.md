# kenken-solver
COMP 560: AI Assignment 1
Cynthia Dong

This project houses three different methods for solving a kenken puzzle: backtracking search (kk0), improved backtracking search (kk1), a genetic algorithm (kk2.ga) and local search (kk2).

To solve kenken puzzles with this code, after downloading, replace the contents of the input.txt file with your own puzzle and run. You will have to run all files, because they sometimes give different outputs.
